The **Frag Grenade** is an explosive [Throwable](/throwables) added in the v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14th, 2024. It can deal high damage, but has an extremely limited inventory capacity and can be risky to use as explosions can deal high damage to the user if the user isn't skilled.

# Strategies
## Using
- Frag Grenades deal lots of damage and can be used to damage or kill an enemy that is in an area where they can't be shot at, such as behind cover.
- Hold down the fire button to start cooking the grenade. To throw it, put your mouse cursor over to the target and release the fire button. All throwables go to where the mouse cursor is to a limited range.
  - Don't cook the grenade for too long (see fuse time), as the grenade can explode in your hands.
- A strategy known as "grenade spamming" is effective during the late game where the safe zone is very small and limiting.
  - To do this, cover most of the safe zone with Grenades by rapidly spamming them. 
  - This will force your opponents out of cover into the zone where you can finish them off using a long ranged weapon.
  - Grenade spamming can also be used to make a quick escape from a fight since it stops opponents from following you.
- You can use the explosive power of the Grenade to launch other grenades, which can be used to damage opponents.
  - This also works on loot. Launching loot out of reach of your opponents can be effective in the end game.

## Countering
- Move away from the grenade to avoid as much damage as possible.
  - This is usually not a challenge but can be if you are in an enclosed space.
- If your opponent utilizes "grenade spamming", you can try to rush forward and out-DPS them close range using a weapon such as the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues).

# Obtaining
Frag Grenades can sometimes be obtained from [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate), but are much more often dropped from (Grenade Crates)[/obstacles/grenade_crate].

# Trivia
- The Frag Grenade is based on the real-life M67 grenade used by the U.S. military
